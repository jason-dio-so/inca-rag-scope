STEP NEXT-57: Candidate Mapping (LEVEL 1)

Generates candidate coverage_code suggestions for unmapped items.
This is NOT a mapping confirmation - candidates are recommendations only.

Constitutional rules:
- NO LLM usage
- NO inference/guessing
- Deterministic token matching only
- Candidates do NOT change Step2-b mapped/unmapped status
