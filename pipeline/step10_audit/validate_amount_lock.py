⛔️ DEPRECATED — IMPORT BLOCKED ⛔️

STEP NEXT-18X-SSOT-LOCK-2:
This module is permanently disabled and cannot be imported or executed.
All legacy code has been purged.

SSOT has moved to:
  - Coverage: data/compare/*_coverage_cards.jsonl
  - Audit: docs/audit/AMOUNT_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md

DO NOT USE step10_audit for validation.

Historical context:
  Pre-flight validation before loading Step7 amounts to DB.
  Replaced by coverage_cards SSOT + audit dashboard workflow.
  For historical implementation details, see git history before STEP NEXT-18X-SSOT-LOCK-2.
