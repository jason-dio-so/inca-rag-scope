# STEP NEXT-70: Proposal DETAIL Coverage KPI Report (Enhanced)

**Generated**: Auto-generated by `tools/report_detail_kpi_all.py`

## KPI Definitions

- **KPI-1A**: `proposal_detail_facts` presence (benefit_description ≠ '명시 없음') ≥ 80% (traditional, all coverages)
- **KPI-1B**: DETAIL extraction rate among structurally available coverages (NEW)
- **KPI-2**: `benefit_description` length ≥ 20 chars ≥ 70%
- **KPI-3**: TOC/section contamination (e.g., '4-1', '특별약관') ≤ 10%
- **KPI-4**: `evidence_refs[0].doc_type == 가입설계서` ≥ 80%

## Action Items

1. **Axes with KPI-1B < 80%**: Profile/extractor generalization needed (true extraction failures)
2. **High KPI-3 (TOC contamination)**: Filter patterns need expansion
3. **Low KPI-4**: Evidence priority enforcement needed
4. **High structural unavailability**: Proposal format limitation (not extraction failure)
